  which can be easily integrated into any D3D and OpenGL / WebGL game engines. It has support for geometry, standard and multi-subobject materials, 
  multitextures, procedural textures, skin and physique modifiers, standard bones, biped and CAT animations, uv transform and much more. 
    
Installation

  Unzip and copy the dle file into the plugins directory of 3ds Max.

  Note that the path to the plugins folder may be different if you have installed 3ds Max to a location other than the default.
